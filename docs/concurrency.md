Write up concurrency control mechanisms used in your service
Write up three cases where your service would encounter phenomenon if it had no concurrency control protection in place. See https://observablehq.com/@calpoly-pierce/isolation-levels for a list of the type of phenomenon you should be referencing. Make a sequence diagram for each case. What will you do to ensure isolation of your transactions and why is that the appropriate case. If you believe your transactions don't have any such cases, your transactions either aren't complex enough and you need to build something more interesting or you aren't understanding what issues are occurring. Note, this can be both how a particular transaction definition interacts with other transaction definitions, but also how a transaction definition interacts with other concurrent instances of itself. Please document all of this in a markdown file named: concurrency.md checked into your group's github.
