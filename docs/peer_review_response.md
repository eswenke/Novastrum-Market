We did not have any peer reviews from our classmates, only from the prof.

Here are the changes we addressed:
* _"making the game easier to understand":_ we will simulate the users in a multiplayer demo
* _"internal server errors with calls to endpoints":_ created a clear starting point of creating a user and logging in with descriptive error messages
* _"how to get citizen id?":_ created a citizen.py file to create a user, establish a role and password, and log in and perform certain actions depending on your role (miner, govt, chemist, civilian)
* _"what's the point of audit?"_
* _"get rid of info/curr_time":_ done!
* _"simplify plan and deliver endpoints":_ condensed the endpoints for miner, govt, and chemist into _do action_
