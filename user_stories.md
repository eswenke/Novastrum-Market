Exceptions:
1. government official rejects bribe -- civilian is sent to space prison permanently and government debt is reduced. government discards the narcotics and keeps the mineable substances on the market.
3. civilian purchasing has no money -- space narcotics remains with seller and civilian is reported to government
4. bidding wars are infinite -- we set a time limit for bidding wars to end
5. someone bets on a bidding war that already ended -- they get a strike and are closer to going to jail (all users have a strike system)
6. imprisons someone under the strike limit -- prisoner gets Voidex in return for their mistake and three free mineable substances
7. initial bid too high -- bid limit for first listing
8. outlaw wants to contaminate everything -- there is a limit placed on the number of narcotics they can contaminate
9. civilian begins a submarket where they are buying and upselling -- they are sent to space prison
10. A civilian is monopolizing and becoming too rich in Voidex -- they must be timed taxes to the space govt
11. theres a draw in the space war -- the head narcotic seller can decide the winner randomly
12. accessing inventory in jail? -- another strike, possibilities of excommunication from planet
13. narcotic re-added after removed -- immediate imprisonment for that individual.
