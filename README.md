Our API idea is about an intergalactic black market. It will include bidding wars, gambling, space drugs, and space crime. There are extraterrestrial lifeforms scowering the black market in search of their next illegal space endeavor. There is an established universe with several moons and planets that each contain mineable 'substances' and life forms. The beings have agreed to incorperate the currency of Voidex

## Planets
Ecliptix, Lyxion IV, Pyre, Sylvaria, Zentharis, with a sun named Celestigon

## Lore
Ecliptix is the main planet in the Novastrum Belt. The Government operates from this planet, and because of this, activity in the Nova Market is held mainly on the other 4 planets. These planets are rich in different minable substances, and their economies are centered around trading and bidding in the Nova Market. 

Ecliptix holds a centralized prison complex known as " ", and criminals from other planets are extradited here upon detainment, reducing activity on the planet from which they leave.

Lyxion IV is a planet that has been war-torn throughout the ages. The government designated this planet as the centralized war hub in order to minimize destruction of the solar system, and all warring groups agreed upon this in a treaty call the Nova War Pact. Over the years, the planet has had to be restructured and rebuilt due to the unihabitable nature of the aftermath following each war. Due to living costs being a fraction of the cost of other planets, Lyxion IV remains populated by residents of the Novastrum Belt.
